# Arbitrage Calculator

http://elliottblack.pythonanywhere.com/

A web application that accesses API data from two cyptocurrency exchange websites (bitbank and binance) and gets the prices for two currency pairs (ETH/BTC and LTC/BTC) and displays this information in a table.  It then calculates the arbitrage percentage and displays this in the second table. 

This application was developed at the request of a client who was interested in getting into arbitrage trading. 

Example trade: start with bitcoin on the bitbank website -> convert to ethereum -> transfer to binance -> convert back to bitcoin -> profit?

'Arbitrage' as defined by google: the simultaneous buying and selling of securities, currency, or commodities in different markets or in derivative forms in order to take advantage of differing prices for the same asset.
